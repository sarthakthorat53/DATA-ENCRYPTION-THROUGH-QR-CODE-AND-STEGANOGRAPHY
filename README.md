# DATA-ENCRYPTION-THROUGH-QR-CODE-AND-STEGANOGRAPHY
This Project enhance security and confidentiality during message transmission by combining steganography with
QR codes. The system takes a user's secret message, encrypts it using QR codes, and then embeds it into an image
file using the stegano tool, resulting in an incomprehensible stegano message. To retrieve the hidden message, the
product includes a decryption process. By merging QR codes with steganography, the project ensures that the
hidden message remains protected from unauthorized access.
